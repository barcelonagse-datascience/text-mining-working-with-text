    "This notebook contains videos and exercises that will guide you through some basic ideas in working with text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals for this notebook are as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Practice practice practice working with text in Python. You will code a lot in these exercises. That's the idea!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. See the techniques make a difference on a very simple problem. This should give you a feel for what these techniques are doing!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Prove (to yourself and to me!) that you understand the techniques by implementing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This repo contains two notebooks: 1) Videos/Exercises 2) A graded assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each video in this notebook is a small exercise. The exercise asks you to _implement_ from scratch the ideas explained in the video. I encourage everyone to try to implement the ideas and to work through the exercises. If you are proficient in Python, they should take less than an hour all together. If you are not proficient in Python, they will be good practice! \n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, you can find solutions to the first few exercises in the `solutions.py` file included in this folder. Those solutions should help you see the effect of the techniques even if you are not able to implement them yourself."
